    info: `Love huskies but don't quite have the space for a medium-sized dog? 
            May we introduce you to the Alaskan Klee Kai — this dog looks just 
            like a husky, but will only weigh up to 15 pounds.`

    info: `Named after the Mexican state of Chihuahua, these loyal and energetic 
            dogs prove that good things do come in small packages — about five 
            pound packages, to be exact.`

    info: `Rumor has it that Teddy Roosevelt coined the name of this pint-sized
            terrier. Beyond being excellent exterminators (hello, city-dwellers), 
            they're loyal, cheerful, and have a silky-smooth coat.`
